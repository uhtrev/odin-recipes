    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <div class="section">
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds bulk breakfast sausage</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 medium bell pepper, finely chopped</li>
            <li>Cooking Spray</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package frozen shredded hash browns</li>
            <li>2½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>12 (10 inch) flour tortillas, warmed</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <div class="section">
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausage and cook, breaking it up with the back of a spoon, until lightly browned and crumbly, about 8 minutes. Add onion and bell pepper; cook until onion is softened, about 5 more minutes. Blot any excess oil in the pan with a paper towel. Continue to cook until sausage is cooked completely, 5 to 7 more minutes. Remove from the heat. (This step can be done 1 day ahead.)</li>
            <li>Spray a slow cooker with cooking spray. Add sausage mixture, hash browns, and Cheddar cheese.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs, milk, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until well blended. Pour into the slow cooker and stir until evenly combined. Cook on Low 6 to 8 hours or on High for 3 to 4 hours, stirring after the first hour.</li>
            <li>Serve mixture inside warmed tortillas with desired toppings.</li>
        </ol>
